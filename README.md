# Linear Algebra from Scratch
**PyLAFS** implements common linear algebraic elements in Python 3.<br>
It runs in the Python interpreter as a convenient matrix computation tool.
### PyLAFS is a package that:
* Implements common linear algebraic constructs and algorithms in **minimal Python** (no external libraries).
* Runs in the interpreter as a convenient calculator for matrix operations and functions.
* Tailors for training, education, and demonstration.
### PyLAFS does NOT:
* Optimize for high-performance computing; there are many other existing tools for that.
* Provide novelty whether theoretical or practical; refer to [**these resources**](https://www.win.tue.nl/~hochsten/journals.html) for novel contributions.
