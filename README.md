From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo):
>A dōjō is a hall or place for immersive learning or meditation.

## Project goal
The goal is to create a package implementing many common mathematical constructs and algorithms in a clean and scalable manner.

## Project rules
1. Implement everything using **minimal Python**.
2. Do **NOT** reuse **any** code from existing mathematics and algorithms libraries.
3. Focus on quality, refactoring, and documentation.
4. Restructure the codebase routinely for good scability.
5. Write demonstrations and instructions for both reviewers (seniors) and beginners (juniors).

## Notes
Novelty is not the aim. Training, education, and demonstration are the aim.
