# Linear Algebra from Scratch
**PyLAFS** implements common elements from linear algebra in Python. It can also run as a convenient matrix computation tool in the Python interpreter. 
### PyLAFS is a package that:
1. Implements common constructs and algorithms from linear algebra.
2. Runs in the interpreter as a convenience matrix calculator.
3. Tailors for training, education, and demonstration.
4. Restricts implementations to **minimal Python**â€”_i.e._ does not use external libraries.
5. Does **NOT** reuse **any** code from existing mathematics and algorithms libraries.

### PyLAFS does NOT:
1. Optimize for high-performance computing; this is a solved problem and there are many existing tools for that.
2. Provide theoretical or practical novelty; refer to [**these resources**](https://www.win.tue.nl/~hochsten/journals.html) for novel contributions to the field.
