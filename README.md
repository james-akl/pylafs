# Linear Algebra from Scratch — using Python
**pylafs** implements common elements from linear algebra in Python.

## Project description
This project is meant to be a dojo for both linear algebra and Python programming.
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dojo):
>A dōjō is a hall or place for immersive learning or meditation.

## Project goals
### pylafs is an experiment that aims to:
1. Create a package implementing many common linear algebraic constructs and algorithms.
2. Manage the codebase growth in a clean and scalable manner.
3. Tailor for training, education, and demonstration.

### pylafs does NOT:
1. Optimize for high-performance computing; this is a solved problem and there are countless tools for that.
2. Provide theoretical or practical novelty; refer to [these resources](https://www.win.tue.nl/~hochsten/journals.html) for novel contributions to the field.

## Project rules
1. Implement are restricted **minimal Python**—_i.e._, avoid libraries at all costs.
2. Do **NOT** reuse **any** code from existing mathematics and algorithms libraries.
3. Libraries peripheral to the objective (_e.g._, GUI) are acceptable. 
4. Focus on quality, refactoring, and documentation.
5. Structure the codebase for good scability.
6. Write demonstrations files and instructions for both reviewers (seniors) and beginners (juniors).
